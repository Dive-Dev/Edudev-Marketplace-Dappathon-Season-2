## üí°Introduction
In today's world, where everything is going digital, education is also changing dramatically. People are constantly seeking new knowledge, and this has sparked a major transformation in the way we learn. One big reason for this change is blockchain technology, which has opened up exciting possibilities for creating transparent and innovative platforms. These platforms are reshaping how courses are not only developed and bought but also how we assign value to them.

Imagine our project as a pioneer in this educational revolution. We've built a special kind of app called a Decentralized Application or Dapp, and it's right at the forefront of this exciting transformation.
 
## üí°Our Vision

Our vision is to create a global ecosystem that democratizes education, making it accessible, affordable, and reliable for everyone. We believe that every individual has the potential to be both a learner and a teacher, and our Dapp is designed to empower them to do so. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, we aim to remove intermediaries, reduce costs, and enhance trust in the educational marketplace.

## üöÄ Setting up the project locally

To run the Edu.dev locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/DiveDev21/Edudev-Learn-and-earn-platform-Dappathon-Season-2
 ```
 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Edudev-Learn-and-earn-platform-Dappathon-Season-2/Frontend
```
3. Node Re-versioning

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

4. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
6. Access the dApp:
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with the EduDev application.

## üîçThe problem it solves

The Dapp addresses several critical issues in the realm of education and online course marketplaces, offering innovative solutions to these challenges:

   **Centralized Intermediaries:** Traditional online course platforms often rely on centralized intermediaries, leading to higher fees and potential data privacy concerns. Our Dapp eliminates the need for these intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology, resulting in lower costs for both creators and learners.

**Limited Access to Quality Content:** Many learners struggle to find high-quality courses that suit their needs and preferences. Our decentralized marketplace democratizes course creation, allowing a diverse range of creators to offer content, thereby expanding access to a wealth of knowledge.

**Trust and Transparency:** Trust is paramount in education, but it's often lacking in online platforms. Blockchain technology ensures transparency and data integrity, as all course-related information and transactions are recorded in an immutable ledger, mitigating concerns about fraudulent or misleading content.

**Incentivizing Reviews:** Encouraging users to provide valuable feedback and reviews can be a challenge. By rewarding reviewers with NFTs, our Dapp incentivizes the community to actively participate in the review process, enhancing the overall quality of the educational offerings.

**Ownership and Control:** Many content creators on centralized platforms have limited control over their content and pricing. Our Dapp empowers creators by allowing them to maintain ownership of their courses and set their own prices, fostering a creator-friendly environment.

**Data Security and Privacy:** Data breaches and privacy concerns are growing issues in the digital age. The Dapp addresses these concerns by securely storing all course-related data on the Spheron SDK, ensuring that user information and transaction history are protected.

**Exclusive NFT Rewards:** Providing NFT rewards for reviewers adds a unique and engaging element to the platform. Users can collect NFTs representing their achievements and contributions, creating a sense of community and value beyond just course content.

## TRACK

## Spheron

It is a decentralized application platform (dApp) that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale their web applications on a global network of servers. Spheron aims to make it easier and more affordable for developers to launch their dApps, by providing them with access to a reliable and scalable infrastructure.

Spheron offers a number of features that make it a popular choice for dApp developers, including:

 - Easy deployment: Spheron makes it easy to deploy dApps with a few simple clicks. Developers can simply push their code to Spheron and their dApp will be up and running in minutes.
 - Global reach: Spheron has a global network of servers, which means that dApps deployed on Spheron can be accessed by users from all over the world.
 - Scalability: Spheron is designed to be scalable, so that dApps can handle even the highest traffic loads.
- Affordability: Spheron is very affordable, with pricing that is significantly lower than traditional cloud hosting providers.


**In this project we are using Spheron SDK for storing  the metadata and Spheron deployment for deploying our site **

**Browser Upload SDK**


The Spheron Browser Upload SDK is a JavaScript library that allows developers to upload files directly from the browser to IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave. This makes it easy to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can store and share data in a secure and reliable way.

To use the Spheron Browser Upload SDK, developers need to first generate an upload token. This can be done by creating a server endpoint that uses the Spheron Storage SDK. Once the upload token has been generated, developers can use it to upload files from their web application.
